Using multiple bears is like creating a scene that tells a story. Check out the bear emoticons below and think about what each scene means. Sometimes, a bear emoji is confessing love to another bear, sometimes a group of friends are huddled together, and sometimes it looks like a single bear is running really fast.Note that these bear emoticons can appear really weird and stretched in in certain browsers. Use Safari for the best chances of these emotes coming out normally."}}
